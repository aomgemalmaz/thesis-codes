The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS based example for the
Freescale 'MKL25' series microcontroller using Freescale 'FRDM-KL25Z' evaluation board
populated with MKL25Z128xxx4 device.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS v2.0).

Example functionality
 - Core Clock runs at 48 MHz

The simple example blinks three LEDs in sequence.
LED D3 is blinking in the sequence Red/Blue/Green/off.

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

The RTX_Blinky program is available in different targets:

  CMSIS-DAP:                       Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   	             and runs from Internal Flash located on chip
                                   		(used for production or target debugging)


  CMSIS-DAP-MTB:                   Debug/Target Driver is configured as CMSIS-DAP OpenSDA
                                   		It shows use of MTB(Micro Trace Buffer)


Selecting "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application:
 1. Start OpenSDA in bootloader mode: Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection whilst pushbutton, SW1 is pressed.
 2. Drag and drop "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file to the OpenSDA mass storage device.
 3. Unplug and plug the OpenSDA USB connection.

Note:
 - "CMSIS-DAP" OpenSDA application file is located in folder "OpenSDA".
 - For more information on OpenSDA, refer to FRDM-KL25Z user manual.

MTB(Micro Trace Buffer) Notes
-------------------------------
- DBG_MTB.ini file configures MTB settings, which allows to configure MTB RAM buffer size, buffer position, and flow control.
- MTB allocates user-defined region of the system RAM for storing instruction address change-of-flow data packets.
  Modify MTB position and size to define the used memory region. The position must be a multiple of the buffer size.
  The allocated buffer region cannot be used as application RAM.
